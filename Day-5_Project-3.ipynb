    "\n",
    "### üìù Description\n",
    "Create a `Book` class to manage a library's inventory. The system should allow borrowing and returning books, while keeping track of availability and borrowers. Extend functionality with a `Library` class to manage multiple books.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîß Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Book Class Attributes:**\n",
    "  - `book_id`\n",
    "  - `title`\n",
    "  - `author`\n",
    "  - `is_available` (default: `True`)\n",
    "  - `borrower` (name of the person who borrowed the book, if any)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Book Class Methods:**\n",
    "  - `__init__(...)` ‚Üí Initialize book details.\n",
    "  - `borrow(borrower_name)` ‚Üí Mark the book as borrowed and record the borrower's name.\n",
    "  - `return_book()` ‚Üí Mark the book as available and clear the borrower.\n",
    "  - `is_available()` ‚Üí Return `True` if the book is available, else `False`.\n",
    "  - `__str__()` ‚Üí Nicely formatted book information.\n",
    "  - `__eq__(other)` ‚Üí Compare books by `book_id`.\n",

    "### ‚úÖ Learning Outcomes\n",
    "- Apply **conditional logic** for borrowing and returning operations.\n",
    "- Use **encapsulation** to manage book state (availability, borrower).\n",
    "- Understand **composition** by building a Library that contains Book objects.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Why __str__ is Called Automatically:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write str(book), Python checks the book object‚Äôs class (Book) for a __str__ method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Book defines __str__, Python calls it to get the string representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is polymorphism: str() works on any object, but the result depends on the object‚Äôs class-specific __str__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thought Process: I chose to use str(book) because it leverages Book‚Äôs __str__ method, avoiding duplicate formatting code. I used join with \\n to make the output readable, like a list of book details. I considered printing directly but returned a string for flexibility (e.g., the caller can print or store it).\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP Pillar: Polymorphism. The Library class uses Book‚Äôs __str__ method without needing to know how it‚Äôs implemented."
