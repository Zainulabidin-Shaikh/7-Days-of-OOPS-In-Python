    "## What is Inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is like a family passing down traits or skills from parents to children. In programming, it lets one class (like a child) \"inherit\" features (like data or actions) from another class (like a parent). This saves time because you don’t have to rewrite the same code, and it helps organize related classes.\n",
